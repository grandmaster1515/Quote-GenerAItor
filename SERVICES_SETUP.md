# Services Management System Setup Guide

This guide covers the new dynamic services management system with custom requirements builder for the Quote GenerAItor dashboard.

## üìã Overview

The Services Management system allows business owners to:

- **Create, edit, and delete services** through an intuitive dashboard
- **Define custom requirements** for each service (what information to collect from customers)
- **Configure different field types**: text, textarea, number, select, multiselect, file upload
- **Reorder requirements** with drag-and-drop functionality
- **Validate all inputs** with comprehensive error handling

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Changes

### New Field Added to `services` Table

```sql
-- Add required_info field to store dynamic requirements
ALTER TABLE services
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS required_info JSONB DEFAULT '[]';

-- Create index for efficient querying
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_services_required_info ON services USING GIN (required_info);
```

### Required Info Structure

The `required_info` field stores an array of requirement objects:

```json
[
  {
    "key": "lot_size",
    "prompt": "What is the approximate square footage of your lawn?",
    "required": true,
    "type": "number"
  },
  {
    "key": "service_address",
    "prompt": "What is the service address?",
    "required": true,
    "type": "text"
  },
  {
    "key": "house_stories",
    "prompt": "How many stories is your house?",
    "required": true,
    "type": "select",
    "options": ["1 Story", "2 Stories", "3+ Stories"]
  }
]
```

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migration

```bash
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Run the migration script
node scripts/runServicesMigration.js
```

### 2. Verify Migration

The script will automatically verify that:
- The `required_info` column was added successfully
- Sample data was updated (if it exists)
- All indexes were created

### 3. Access the Dashboard

1. Navigate to your dashboard: `http://localhost:5173`
2. Click on the **"Services"** tab
3. Click **"Add New Service"** to create your first service

## üîó API Integration

### Updated Endpoints

```javascript
// Create service with requirements
POST /api/services/:businessId
{
  "name": "Gutter Cleaning",
  "description": "Professional gutter cleaning",
  "pricing_info": "Starting at $150",
  "required_info": [
    {
      "key": "house_stories",
      "prompt": "How many stories is your house?",
      "required": true,
      "type": "select",
      "options": ["1 Story", "2 Stories", "3+ Stories"]
    }
  ]
}

// Update service with requirements
PUT /api/services/:businessId/:serviceId
{
  "name": "Updated Service Name",
  "required_info": [...]
}
```

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Create a new service** with 2-3 requirements
2. **Edit an existing service** and modify its requirements
3. **Delete a service** and verify it's removed
4. **Test validation** by submitting invalid data
5. **Reorder requirements** using drag and drop
6. **Test different field types** (text, select, etc.)

### Sample Test Service

Create a test service called "Test Service" with these requirements:

```json
[
  {
    "key": "test_text",
    "prompt": "Enter some text:",
    "required": true,
    "type": "text"
  },
  {
    "key": "test_select",
    "prompt": "Choose an option:",
    "required": true,
    "type": "select",
    "options": ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3"]
  },
  {
    "key": "test_textarea",
    "prompt": "Enter additional details:",
    "required": false,
    "type": "textarea"
  }
]
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Migration fails**
   - Check database connection
   - Ensure user has ALTER TABLE permissions
   - Run: `node scripts/runServicesMigration.js`

2. **Requirements not saving**
   - Check browser console for validation errors
   - Verify API endpoint is accessible
   - Check backend logs for detailed errors

3. **Requirements not displaying**
   - Verify data was saved to database
   - Check that `required_info` field is included in API responses
   - Clear browser cache and refresh

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check if migration was successful
psql -d your_database -c "SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'services' AND column_name = 'required_info';"

# View sample service with requirements
psql -d your_database -c "SELECT name, required_info FROM services WHERE required_info IS NOT NULL AND required_info != '[]'::jsonb LIMIT 1;"
```

## üéâ Success Criteria

You've successfully set up the Services Management system when:

‚úÖ **Database migration completed** without errors

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors

3. Verify database migration completed successfully
4. Ensure all required dependencies are installed

The system is designed to be intuitive for non-technical users while providing powerful customization options for service requirements.
