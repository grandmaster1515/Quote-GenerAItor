Project context
You are implementing two critical features for an existing AI-powered chat widget that is already integrated with RAG capabilities for business-specific answers. This widget is part of a SaaS application called "Quote generAItor" that helps service/trades/contractor businesses capture leads and generate quotes through conversational AI.
The existing system already has:

AI chatbot with RAG integration for business-specific answers
Lead capture functionality (email + name + address)
Lead database and dashboard
Quote generation capabilities
PDF quote generation

Feature 1: Configurable Decision Tree UX Implementation
Core Requirements
1.1 Frontend Chat Interface Components
Create a decision tree conversation flow system with the following UI elements:
Interactive Message Bubbles:

Design clickable option bubbles that appear below the AI's messages
Bubbles should be visually distinct from regular chat messages (consider using a different background color, border, or hover effect)
Each bubble should be responsive and mobile-friendly
Implement smooth animations when bubbles appear/disappear
Support both clickable bubbles AND free text input (user can either click a bubble or type their own message)

Visual Specifications:

Bubble styling: Rounded corners, subtle shadow, primary brand color border
Hover state: Slight scale increase (1.05x) and darker border
Selected state: Fill with primary color, white text
Spacing: 8px between bubbles, 16px margin from chat message
Max width: 80% of chat container width on mobile, auto-fit content on desktop
Typography: 14px font size, medium weight

1.2 Decision Tree Structure
Implement a three-branch primary decision tree with the following paths:
Path 1: Get an Estimate
Root → "Get an estimate" 
  → AI: "I'd be happy to help you get an estimate. Please describe what you're looking to have done."
  → [Free text input from user]
  → AI analyzes input and suggests relevant services
  → AI: "Based on your description, here's what I understand you need: [summary]. Would you like to add this to your service needs?"
  → [Yes/No bubbles]
  → If Yes: Add to cart and continue
  → AI: "What's your timeline for this service?"
  → [ASAP / Within a week / Within a month / Flexible bubbles]
  → Collect contact information if not already provided
  → Generate quote request
Path 2: Our Services
Root → "Our services"
  → AI: "Here are our available services. Select one to learn more:"
  → [Dynamic service bubbles based on business configuration]
  → User selects service
  → AI: Provides pre-configured service description
  → AI: "Would you like to add this service to your quote request?"
  → [Yes/No/Tell me more bubbles]
  → If Yes: Prompt for service-specific details
  → Add to service needs cart
Path 3: FAQ
Root → "FAQ"
  → AI: "Here are some frequently asked questions. Select one or type your own question:"
  → [Dynamic FAQ bubbles based on business configuration]
  → User selects question
  → AI: Provides pre-configured answer
  → AI: "Was this helpful? Do you have another question?"
  → [Yes, another question / No, I'd like a quote / Back to main menu bubbles]
1.3 Backend Configuration System

javascript{
  service: "string",
  details: {
    quantity: "number/string",
    measurement: "string",
    specifications: ["string"],
    customRequirements: "string"
  },
  estimatedPrice: "string (optional)",
  confidenceScore: "number (0-1)"
}
Popup UI Elements:

Service name (editable)
Auto-extracted details (editable fields)
Quantity selector (if applicable)
Additional notes text field
"Add to Service Needs" button
"Cancel" button
"Modify" option to adjust before adding

2.3 Cart Interaction Examples
Example A - Service Selection Flow:
User: Clicks "Our Services" → Selects "Lawn Cutting"
AI: "We provide professional lawn cutting services for residential and commercial properties. Our service includes mowing, edging, and grass clipping removal. Pricing starts at $X per visit."
User: "I have a 3000 sqft lawn I want cut"
AI: "I can add lawn cutting for your 3000 sqft property to your service needs. Based on the size, this would typically be a [weekly/bi-weekly] service."
[Popup appears with pre-filled details:
- Service: Lawn Cutting
- Property Size: 3000 sqft
- Frequency: (dropdown) Weekly/Bi-weekly/Monthly/One-time
- Special instructions: (text field)]
User: Clicks "Add to Service Needs"
[Cart icon shows (1) badge]
Example B - Natural Language Flow:
User: Clicks "Get an estimate"
AI: "I'd be happy to help you get an estimate. Please describe what service you need."
User: "I have 20 windows that need washing"
AI: "I understand you need window washing for 20 windows. Let me add this to your service needs so we can provide an accurate quote."
[Popup appears with:
- Service: Window Washing
- Number of Windows: 20
- Type: (dropdown) Residential/Commercial
- Floors: (dropdown) Single story/Multi-story
- Frequency: (dropdown) One-time/Monthly/Quarterly
- Additional needs: (checkboxes) Interior only/Exterior only/Both sides]
User: Fills details and clicks "Add to Service Needs"
[Cart updates with new item]
2.4 Cart Data Management
Service Needs Data Structure:
javascript{
  sessionId: "string",
  userId: "string (if logged in)",
  leadId: "string",
  cartItems: [
    {
      id: "unique_string",
      serviceType: "string",
      serviceName: "string",
      details: {

}
Cart Persistence:

Save cart state to localStorage for guest users
Sync with backend database for logged-in users
Maintain cart across page refreshes

2.5 AI Intelligence Layer
Service Recognition Engine:
Implement NLP capabilities to:

Extract service types from natural language
Identify quantities and measurements
Recognize temporal requirements (urgency, frequency)
Parse location/area specifications
Detect special requirements or constraints

Contextual Suggestions:
The AI should proactively suggest related services:

If user adds "gutter cleaning", suggest "roof inspection"
If user adds "lawn mowing", suggest "edging" or "fertilization"
Bundle suggestions for cost savings

Validation Rules:

Minimum information required per service type
Logical consistency checks (e.g., square footage within reasonable ranges)
Duplicate service detection and merging
Required field validation before cart submission

Integration Requirements

Link cart data to lead profile
Track conversation history with cart interactions
Update lead score based on cart value

Quote Generation Integration:

Transform cart items into quote line items
Pass structured data to PDF generation system
Include all specifications and custom requirements
Calculate pricing based on business rules

Dashboard Integration:

Real-time cart visibility in business dashboard
Notification when cart is submitted
Ability to view cart contents alongside chat transcript
